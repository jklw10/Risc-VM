LANGUAGE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY & SPECIFICATION:
No Primitive Types: 
   The compiler natively has no concept of `int`, `float`, or `bool`. 
   The implicit default type is raw memory (`bytes`).

Types are Comptime Memory Slices: 
   A "Type" is simply an alias for an allocation size on the stack. 
   Example: `int = (bytes[:4])` tells the compiler to allocate 4 bytes.
   
   This should enable typed pointer's benefits?.

Library-Defined Operations: 
   Operators (+, -, *, ==) are not built-in. They are syntactic sugar for 
   type methods (e.g., `value.@op(+)`). The Standard Library defines these 
   using inline `@asm` mapped to raw CPU instructions.


Data Movement (:) vs. Mutation (=):
   `:` denotes value movement, type aliasing, or passing data across scopes.
     it is "to", "0:4" = "0 to 4", (in):{ctx}:res, is a pipeline definition.
   `=` denotes explicit identity assignment and runtime memory mutation.
     it is "is", "res = 4"

The Universal Pipeline Construct: 
   There is syntactically no distinction between functions, loops, namespaces, 
   and type definitions. They are all structural variants of a Universal Pipeline.
   Format: `return = (bindings) : { body } `

   
Data-Driven Control Flow (Zero-Keyword Branching):
   The language contains ZERO native control flow keywords (`if`, `while`, `else`).
   Conditional branching is an emergent property of temporal pipelines (loops). 
   An "if statement" is simply a loop pipeline constrained to execute 0 or 1 times 
   based on a dynamic truth condition (e.g., `( c = 0 : condition ) : { ... }`).
   
Pre-Declaration & Zero-Initialization:
   Declaring a typed variable at a block boundary (e.g., `res[int] = ... : { }`) 
   allocates and zero-initializes it in the outer scope, allowing inner 
   blocks to mutate it explicitly without scope-popping issues.

Raw Memory & Unsafe Transparency:
   The language operates as an ultra-high-level macro assembler. Direct 
   memory dereferencing (`[ptr]`), pointer arithmetic, and transparent 
   bridging to CPU registers via `@asm` are first-class workflows. Strings 
   do not exist natively; they are treated strictly as memory slices or 
   embedded binaries.

Explicit mutation:
  No hidden mutations, aka no side effects without visibility

Caller is responsible for allocation.
A pipeline's only purpose is to transform data.
Aim to be rid of all keywords.
